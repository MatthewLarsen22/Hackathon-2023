# Hackathon-2023
This project was created by Iain McMurray, Brynne Larsen, and Matthew Larsen during USU's Hackathon on March 24th and 25th of 2023.
It is a clone of the multiplayer game mode of the NES game *Super Bomberman 2*. 
The project was written in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. 
All code and images were created within 24 hours during the hackathon.

## Project Requirements
- There should be a main menu with the name of the game
- There should be an instructions page teaching players how to play
- In game, there should be two characters. Each is controllable by a player.
  - Player 1 moves their character by using WASD.
  - Player 2 moves their character by using the arrow keys.
- The players can place bombs which explode after a fixed amount of time.
  - Player 1 places a bomb by pressing Space Bar.
  - Player 2 places a bomb by pressing Enter.
- Players are given 3 lives per game.
- If a player is near a bomb when the bomb explodes, the player will lose a life.
- The last player standing wins the game.

The following items will be addressed if time permits:
- A single game should not be longer than 3-5 minutes. If no winner is found by the end of that time frame, a draw is declared.
- In the last minute of the game, a border should start filling in around the edges of the map forcing players towards the center.
- Crates will be placed randomly around the map (excluding corners where players spawn) separating players from each other. 
- Some crates may contain one of the following powerups inside them:
  - An additional bomb.
  - A more powerful bomb.
  - A boost to the player's speed
  - the ability to kick bombs by walking into them after they have been placed
  - The ability to throw bombs by pressing space while standing on top of a bomb that has been placed
- Score is calculated based off of the amount of time remaining in a round.
- A high scores page can be added to the main menu to keep track of high scores
- A song should be added during gameplay
- There should be audio playing when a bomb explodes
